# Birthday Scratch

## Normal level

![](img/game.png)

We're celebrating a birthday, so let’s throw birthday cakes at a robot! You’re either going to need Scratch 3 installed on your computer, or you can use Scratch 3 online at [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu).

### One I made earlier

You can play a version of this game at [dojo.soy/birthdayscratch](http://dojo.soy/birthdayscratch) to see how it works.

----

Everything you need to create this game is in the Scratch sprite library, apart from the CoderDojo logo, which you can download from [dojo.soy/birthdaylogo](http://dojo.soy/birthdaylogo). If you want your game to play notes for a birthday song, you need to add the music extension in Scratch.

Here’s the code for your sprites:

### Cake code

### Robot code

### Wand code

## Hard level

Now you can add some more stuff: make your game check for a particular score and tell the player they’ve won when they reach this score.

To do that, you need to create a new ‘You win!’ sprite using Scratch's editing tools.

Then you need to add to and change some bits of your code:

### 'You win' code

### Robot code

### Wand code

## Ultra level

Change your game so that you score points when you **don’t** hit the robot. Or, make your game play _Happy Birthday_, like the version of the game you tried out. You decide!
